    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These tuna and artichoke wraps are so tasty, you might want to eat the filling with just a fork over lettuce, but no matter what, make sure you add the French-fried onions on top. Tuna and artichoke combine with cucumber, tomatoes, a zing of lemon, and crispy onions—you’ll want to come back for more of these simple wraps.</p>
