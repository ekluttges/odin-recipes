    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These tuna and artichoke wraps are so tasty, 
           you might want to eat the filling with just a fork over lettuce, 
           but no matter what, make sure you add the French-fried onions on top.
           Tuna and artichoke combine with cucumber, tomatoes, a zing of lemon, and crispy 
           onions—you’ll want to come back for more of these simple wraps.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <u>2 (5-ounce) cans tuna, drained
            1 (7 1/2-ounce) jar artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
            1 mini cucumber, chopped
            1/2 cup chopped grape tomatoes
            1/3 cup mayonnaise
            1/2 teaspoon ground mustard

            1 lemon, zested

            3 (10-inch) sun-dried tomato basil tortillas
            6 lettuce leaves
            6 tablespoons French-fried onions</u>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>Stir tuna, artichokes, 
            cucumber, tomatoes, mayonnaise, mustard, garlic salt, 
            lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a bowl.
            Lay out tortillas on a work surface; 
            lay 2 lettuce leaves on each tortilla. 
            Spoon tuna mixture in a line across the middle of each tortilla; 
            top tuna with 2 tablespoons French-fried onions. 
            Fold opposing edges of tortilla to overlap the filling. 
            Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling creating a burrito.
